Hi there. I was inspired to make this post after seeing u/Sodium_Brain’s post about Goals  (Reddit Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/bh4yfl/goals/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/bh4yfl/goals/)). It's inspiring, really! While these goals are long term and answer the question “WHY” we invest , some people who are starting up may also have some goals they wish to fulfil before they enter the investments arena. I was in this space last year. My goal was to build. Do you know how much money you've needlessly spent over a given period of time? I recently did the math for myself. For a period of 30 months not so long ago I took home 2,404. My basic living expenses were ,400. At the end of that 30-month period I had a grand total of ,740 in checking. Fuck me. Where the fuck did 97% of my extra cash go? Managing our finances has to be one of our top priorities. Lest we desire to make ends meet till the day of our death we need to hold ourselves. TLDR: Watch the video about overlapping center backs in 3atb formations. Do you think that could work for us? Has anyone seen this post (https://www.footballdna.co.uk/features/sheffield-united-3-5-2-attacking-overlapping-centre-backs/) about Sheffield United on r/soccer a few days ago? It's a video about their tactics and how they use overlapping center backs in a 3-5-2 formation, to situationally overload the wings. It seems to work for them as they are unexpectedly on their way to promotion. The members of Ghost held a meeting on October 4, 2011. At the meeting, Sissi Hagald and Magnus Strömblad were also present. Magnus Strömblad worked as a financial consultant especially in relation to music groups. Magnus Strömblad told us during his testimony, among other things, that it was Sissi Hagald who had asked him to attend the meeting, that he, at the meeting, had said that he used to form an economic association for his bands, that TF had asked him after the meeting to creat. Hello, I've only recently started to follow the discussions in this subreddit on a regular basis, and since Riot now apparently wants to dedicate some resources into improving the game mode, I wanted to express my thoughts on the game mode pre- and post-update.

I think I've peaked at \~2900 MMR, but I often 
I read some comments having queries about how does box-office work? So thought of making this topic. This article was written by Indicine Team four years ago. They have removed the article, this is a copy of the same. A lot of our readers wonder how a film that earns around Rs 60 crores, like an Action Jackson, is declared a FLOP' at the box office. On the other hand, a film like Hate Story 2 that earns just Rs 28 crores, is declared a HIT'. So how exactly are verdicts So I realized that not everyone that wants to FIRE is necessarily savvy with Excel or with math in general. I took a quick few numbers to do a simplified calculation of how many years of saving it would take to hit the standard goal of saving up 25x annual spending. The 25x is a rule of thumb found in the FAQs of this forum. This is really just for estimation since real savings and returns aren't going to be identical year after year. I assumed a net return on investments (after inflation). I made an excel sheet that tells me when I will reach my target SWR income based on how much I invest each year, my annual ROI, and an assumption that inflation will stay constant. These were my parameters: \- A contribution of 0K to the retirement fund each year (Assuming a net income of 160K with yearly expenses of 60K) \- A target SWR income goal equal to the 75th percentile of individual/single income (adjusted for inflation) that is less than 4% of the retirement fund ( which is ,0. As entrepreneurs and business owners, we have a limited number of hours in the day to fit in everything we need to get done for our businesses and then to add in the extra hours spent in the gym and cooking healthy meals can make it difficult to stay in tip-top shape. But the catch is, for your business to excel you need to be at your best. And let's face it, you can't be at your best when you're an overweight, tired, lazy lump. Yesterday I wrote about the reasons why you should be staying. I am new to reddit I found this page about a few weeks ago and wow. There is a lot of value here!

They were fine for playing shows in dimly lit bars, rented warehouses, etc. back in the day, but I've recently gotten into music again and recording especially.
